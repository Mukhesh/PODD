# Data points extracted from SM-PWM-01C data sheet's LPO vs. Dust
# Concentration plot using Plot Digitizer (visual point selection on a
# PNG image of the plot).  Axes:
# 
#   Concentration: dust concentration (ug/m^3).
# 
#   LPO: low pulse occupancy (fractional).
#        Average, minimum, and maximum values provided;
#        unclear how many samples this range was based on.
# 
# LPO point selection resolution was ~ 0.0004.  Concentration axis was
# non- linear, but values were given explicitly.  However, it was
# difficult to find and select the line nodes, so point selections might
# be slightly off. In any case, the minimum/maximum measurement range
# is far larger than point selection errors.
# 
# Note: Though not shown on the plot, the curve should go through (0,0).
